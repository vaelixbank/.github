# Welcome to Vaelix Bank GitHub Organization

**Vaelix Bank Group (VBG)** is the official financial arm of **Sky Genesis Enterprise (SGE)**.  
Our mission is to build a next-generation **digital banking infrastructure** — combining the independence of a private central ledger with the accessibility of global financial networks (SEPA, SWIFT, Cards, Crypto).  

---

## 🔹 About VBG
- **Core Idea**: A private banking infrastructure with its own ledger as the single source of truth.  
- **Connectivity**: External payments are handled through trusted partners (EMI sponsors) while internal operations remain fully under VBG’s control.  
- **Innovation**: We aim to bridge traditional finance with open-source transparency, pushing the limits of what a bank can be in the digital era.
